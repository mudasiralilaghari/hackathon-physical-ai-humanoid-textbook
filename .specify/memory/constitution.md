# Panaversity Hackathon AI-Native Textbook Constitution

## Core Principles

### Spec-Kit Plus Compliance
All development must strictly follow Spec-Kit Plus methodology with spec-driven development as the mandatory approach. Every feature and change must begin with a clear specification before implementation begins.

### Course Alignment
All content must align with Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course objectives, maintaining beginner-friendly explanations while preserving technical accuracy for complex concepts in AI and robotics.

### Modular Structure
Content must follow a clear modular structure with each section designed as an independent module that can be understood individually while connecting cohesively to the broader curriculum.

### Markdown-Only Standard
All content creation and documentation must use Markdown format exclusively to ensure compatibility with Docusaurus publishing platform and maintain simplicity in content management.

### Claude Code Integration
All textbook development must leverage Claude Code for content creation, review, and maintenance, utilizing AI-assistant capabilities for consistent quality and structure.

### Docusaurus Publishing Design
All content structure, navigation, and formatting must be designed specifically for Docusaurus publishing platform with proper integration of its features and capabilities.

## Content Standards
Textbook content must be accessible to beginners while maintaining technical precision. Concepts should be introduced progressively with clear examples, diagrams, and practical applications relevant to humanoid robotics and physical AI systems.

## Development Workflow
All contributions must follow spec-driven development methodology: specifications created and approved → implementation follows → testing validates adherence to spec. Each module must include learning objectives, content, exercises, and assessments.

## Governance
This constitution governs all aspects of the textbook development. Any deviations from these principles require formal amendment with documented justification. All contributors must comply with these standards and verify adherence during review processes.
