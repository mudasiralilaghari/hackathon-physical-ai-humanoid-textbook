# Module 1: ROS 2 (Robotic Nervous System)

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics textbook. This module introduces you to Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2), the communication backbone for robotic systems.

## Module Overview

ROS 2 serves as the "nervous system" for robotic applications, enabling different components to communicate and coordinate effectively. Just as our nervous system allows different parts of our body to work together seamlessly, ROS 2 allows various robotic subsystems to interact and function as a unified whole.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:
- Understand ROS 2 architecture and communication patterns
- Create and manage ROS 2 nodes for different robot components
- Implement message passing between robot subsystems
- Configure and launch complex robotic systems
- Use ROS 2 tools for debugging and monitoring

## Module Structure

This module consists of five chapters that progressively build your understanding of ROS 2:

1. **Chapter 1.1**: Introduction to ROS 2 Architecture
2. **Chapter 1.2**: Working with Nodes and Messages
3. **Chapter 1.3**: Services and Actions in Robotics
4. **Chapter 1.4**: Parameter Management and Launch Systems
5. **Chapter 1.5**: Debugging and Monitoring ROS 2 Systems

## Prerequisites

Before starting this module, ensure you have:
- Completed the setup guide
- Basic Python programming knowledge
- Understanding of fundamental programming concepts

## About ROS 2

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) is not an actual operating system but rather a flexible framework for writing robotic software. It provides hardware abstraction, device drivers, libraries, visualizers, message-passing, package management, and more. ROS 2 is designed to be suitable for real applications and addresses many of the limitations of the original ROS framework, particularly in areas like security, real-time support, and multi-robot systems.

ROS 2 is widely used in both research and industry, from small educational robots to large-scale industrial automation systems. Understanding ROS 2 is fundamental to working with modern robotic systems.
