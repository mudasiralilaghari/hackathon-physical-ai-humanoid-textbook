# Module 1: ROS 2 – The Robotic Nervous System

Welcome to the module on ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), the standard middleware for robotics development. This module introduces you to the architecture that connects different components of robotic systems, enabling them to communicate and work together effectively.

## Chapters in this Module

- [Chapter 1.1: Introduction to ROS 2 Architecture](./chapter-1.1.md)
- [Chapter 1.2: Nodes and Topics](./chapter-1.2.md)
